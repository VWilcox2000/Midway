<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>The Battle
for Midway is a somewhat modernized game modeled after the ‘Midway Campaign’
game released by Avalon Hill in the early 80’s.  While limited to ASCII text,
the game did an excellent job putting you into the position of Admiral Chester
Nimitz, RADM Fletcher, and  RADM Spruance leading numerically inferior and far
less experienced carrier forces against the far more impressive, at least on
paper, Kidō Butai (&quot;Mobile Force&quot;) of the Japanese.  After the
Doolittle raid, Admiral Yamamoto, to eliminate the United States as a threat in
the Pacific had set up a complicated plan to invade the Aleutians as a
diversion while sending a massive invasion fleet led by the experienced and
battle hardened Kidō Butai that had attacked Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese force
was slightly diminished due to losses during the Battle of the Coral Sea, but
they believed the United States only had two fleet carriers in the entire
Pacific.  This was incorrect, however, as the Yorktown, despite suffering
apparent catastrophic damage during the Battle of the Coral Sea was rapidly
repaired by a tireless damage control team in more rapid fashion than the
Japanese could have believed.  Furthermore, the United States had broken the
Japanese naval codes allowing them to determine that Midway, not the Aleutian
Islands was Yamamoto’s real target.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>While not
expecting it, Yamamoto did consider the possibility of United States carriers
being in the theater.  He ordered Admiral Nagumo commanding the Kidō Butai to
keep two of his carriers in reserve for strikes against American carriers
should they make an appearance.  In the actual battle, Nagumo, PBY’s were
spotted overhead the morning of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, so it was no surprise when
a strike from Midway attacked his fleet before his first strike could hit the
airfield on Eastern Midway Island.  Midway had time to launch all of her
fighters, but they were comprised of outdated Buffalo F2A as well as the not
exactly superb F4F wildcat numbering 24 in total versus the nimble and superior
A6M zero.  The United States lost 2 of the F4F’s and the 13 of the Buffaloes
were slaughtered.  Many of the American pilots had not faced the zero and
survivors were stunned at how inferior their planes were wanting both of them
retired, not just the F2A which mostly served as a trainer.  While the Japanese
devastated Midway’s infrastructure, power, and fuel facilities, they failed to
significantly damage the air field while having over 20% of their attack planes
lost or out of service after the attack.  The strike from Midway failed to
inflict significant damage on the Japanese fleet; even a number of B-17’s
dropping numerous large bombs failed to score hits as their high-altitude bombs
left the Japanese carriers ample time for evasive maneuvers.  Nagumo set out to
rearm his carrier attack forces for a follow-up attack on Midway.  Before that
could be completed, one of his PBY’s, coincidentally the only one to have
mechanical issues delaying her launch by at least half an hour found the US
carrier fleet to the Northeast.  This led to Nagumo’s dilemma.  He had to
coordinate landing his returning strike, yet again rearming his planes, or
launching planes with sub-optimally armed for a carrier strike.  He chose to
recover his strike, rearm, and make a massive strike on whatever US forces
where to the Northeast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>Unfortunately
for Nagumo, the rest of the day his fleet would be largely occupied dealing
with attacks from United States planes.  Aside from the strike from Midway, US
fliers, inexperienced US fliers, failing to organize into a consolidated attack
showed up in small waves that generally prevented the Japanese from launching
their strike despite most of them failing to score any hits on Japanese forces
for most of the day.  TBD pilots had generally thought well of their plane up
until this battle, and they had managed to perform fairly well in the Coral Sea
due to optimum conditions and an ability to bracket Japanese carriers, but at
Midway TBD’s showed up in isolated squadrons having to approach carriers behind
massive walls of AA and they were butchered, generally before they could get
close enough to drop their torpedoes.  Dropped from one side at a distance, the
torpedoes were not difficult for Japanese carriers to dodge, and unbeknownst to
most of those TBD pilots, their torpedoes most often did not explode if they
did manage a hit.  Despite this, most TBD squadrons that day pushed on against
overwhelming odds.  No torpedo hits were scored on Japanese carriers, but these
brave TBD crews won the war by giving up their lives.  Each time a TBD squadron
showed up, they forced the Japanese to go into evasive maneuvers and delayed
their attack on the US fleet.  The USS Hornet, with perhaps the least
experienced flight crew and fighter complement having been pulled straight out
of training into serving as the platform for the Doolittle raid, launched their
strike far out to the west as the United States did not know if the Japanese
had four carriers in one group or two separate groups with one farther behind. 
As a result, their first launch led to the infamous Flight to Nowhere, but LCDR
Waldron, refusing to follow orders that were clearly leading them away from the
carriers took his TBD’s and broke off to the south.  His squadron arrived yet
again just in time to force the Japanese onto defense yet again.  The entire
squadron was annihilated including LCDR Waldron, though one pilot, Ensign
George gay managed to survive by hiding under a seat cushion in sight of
Japanese forces on all sides.  Waldron’s move, though, saved the United States
that day as Japanese combat air patrols, suffering from poor radio
communication systems, failed to properly maintain high- and low-level patrols
with most of their planes greedily chasing down TBD’s for more kills.  This
would provide the United States the opportunity it needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>While the
Japanese were busy defending from TBD attacks taking evasive action to avoid
torpedoes, LCMDR McClusky’s squadron of scout bombers in VF-6 had arrived at
where the Japanese carrier fleet had been only to find them missing (they had
moved to the Northwest).  Faced with the decision to divert to Midway to refuel
or return to the Enterprise, McClusky astutely noticed the IJN Arashi, a Japanese
destroyed steaming north at flank speed which he correctly surmised was towards
the Japanese fleet – his decision to follow that destroyer was later called by
Nimitz the most important decision of the entire battle.  In another moment of
benevolence, earlier that morning the USS Nautilus had attempting to attack the
Japanese fleet and the Arashi had been sent to attempt to hunt her down.  They
came upon the Japanese fleet with much of its fighter cover at sea level after
chasing the TBD’s.  There was confusion over target assignment with most
bombers going after Kaga but Lt. Richard Best and his two wingmen diverted in
time to attack the Akagi.  The Kaga took 4 hits and was a burning wreck.  The
Akagi, though seemingly better off would later explode as gas vapors would
spread and find an ignition source.  In another favorable moment for the United
States, just as McClusky’s flight group arrived in the Southwest, the
Yorktown’s squadron of SBD’s arrived to the Northeast – a matter of absolute
failure to coordinate leading to a perfect bracketing of the fleet.  The
Yorktown fliers pummeled the Soryu leaving her a burning wreck.  Unfortunately,
Hiryu was just over the horizon.  She launched a strike which followed the
American pilots back to Yorktown where they disabled her.  She was rapidly
repaired but a subsequent strike caused more significant damage before a joint
strike by Yorktown and Enterprise bombers left Hiryu ablaze – Lt. Richard Best
again scoring one of the four hits that doomed her.  All four Japanese carriers
were then, ironically, sunk by torpedoes… Japanese torpedoes before the fleet
retreated back towards Japan.  Yorktown almost pulled another miraculous
recovery, but the IJN I-168, an intrepid submarine managed to put two torpedoes
into the Yorktown followed by a third into the destroyer USS Hammann that had
been tending to her – leading to the loss of 80 lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>As good as
the original game is, it did seem to favor some misperceptions that are also
seen in the 1976 film Midway – that armed planes on the deck led to great
explosions that put the carriers out of action.  Most historians now seem to
favor fuel vapors building up in the hangars and poor damage control practices
exacerbating Japanese losses.  I have remodeled that game to focus less on the
planes on deck though there are still explosions, and the United States has an
even more dramatic edge in damage control than provided in the original game. 
While the player may not know it, the Japanese carriers do follow Yamamoto’s
orders on way in with half the fleet armed for ground attack.  If the Japanese
fleet discovers the US carriers, they will rearm potentially leading to a
delay.  Another factor the original game did not consider is the US having
radar.  I have incorporated potential contact spotting by submarines and radar
in addition to PBY scout planes.  If a contact is spotted on radar, it is not
identified, but can provide a player clues.  Of more import, if the Japanese
launch a strike, you will be warned of approaching bogies by the radar crew…
well, most of the time – there is some chance they will consider it a weather
anomaly or friendly planes and not report it – as tended to happen in the early
days of radar.  I have also added in visual spotting of adjacent forces as it
only makes common sense.  In a future version, I probably will allow you to
launch scout strikes to go where you THINK the Japanese fleet is…  at a
slightly greater risk of planes splashing (especially if they are from the
Hornet).  I also plan on adding in the B-17’s from Midway as an option to
harass the Japanese periodically until they put Midway airfield out of
operation or destroy them on the ground.  The game does not currently delay
Japanese flight operations if the US attacks, but requiring decisions on
whether to launch or continue evasion and forcing you to turn into the wind for
launching strikes might be added in a future version.  I did give the Yorktown
fighters a significant edge as compared to other US fighter squadrons based on
LCMDR Jimmy Thach of Yorktown’s VF-3 successfully implementing what would later
become known as the “Thach weave” – a tactic where F4F’s, rather than
attempting to outturn the far nimbler Zero’s would weave back and forth with
their wingman so that either could shoot any zero off the tail of the other. 
While far nimbler, the A6M Zero lacked a self-sealing gas tank and was not hard
to shoot down if you could get it in front of your plane.  This doctrine would
later be taught to all F4F squadrons along with some other tactics to help
somewhat even the playing field, but at Midway, only Thach’s group was using
this tactic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>The original
game also included an escort carrier, the Zuiho, in the Japanese troop
transport group.  I have not only kept this in, but this carrier now will
actively go to war at times.  In addition to performing CAP for the transports
against air attacks, she will venture out with a strike force of her own if the
situation calls for it – say no other carriers are around (or still afloat) –
and there is a target in range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>While I have
not yet implemented multi-level CAP which might be more complicated than the
game needs, I did add some more CAP and squadron diversion logic.  There are
limits on how many planes can divert to a carrier, though diversions to Midway
face no such limit as there is no space limit there.  Much as in real life, the
TBD squadron’s are almost a wasted effort in this game, though they do
occasionally score some devastating hits, but more importantly, CAP has a
recovery time in this game – if subsequent waves show up in sequence, Japanese
fighter cover can be inadequate.</span></p>
