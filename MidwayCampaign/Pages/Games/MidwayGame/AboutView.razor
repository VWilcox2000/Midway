                The Battle
                for Midway is a somewhat modernized game modeled after the ‘Midway Campaign’
                game released by Avalon Hill in the early 80’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>While limited to ASCII text, the game did an excellent job putting you
                into the position of Admiral Chester Nimitz leading numerically inferior and
                far less experienced carrier forces against the far more impressive, at least
                on paper, Kidō Butai (&quot;Mobile Force&quot;) of the Japanese.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the Doolittle raid, Admiral Yamamoto,
                to eliminate the United States as a threat in the Pacific had set up a
                complicated plan to invade the Aleutians as a diversion while sending a massive
                invasion fleet led by the experienced and battle hardened Kidō Butai that had
                attacked Pearl Harbor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Japanese
                force was slightly diminished due to losses during the Battle of the Coral Sea,
                but they believed the United States only had two fleet carriers in the entire
                Pacific.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was incorrect, however, as
                the Yorktown, despite suffering apparent catastrophic damage during the Battle
                of the Coral Sea was rapidly repaired by a tireless damage control team in more
                rapid fashion than the Japanese could have believed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the United States had broken the
                Japanese naval codes allowing them to determine that Midway, not the Aleutian
                Islands was Yamamoto’s real target.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>
              <span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                While not
                expecting it, Yamamoto did consider the possibility of United States carriers
                being in the theater.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He ordered Admiral
                Nagumo commanding the Kidō Butai to keep two of his carriers in reserve for
                strikes against American carriers should they make an appearance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the actual battle, Nagumo, <span class=GramE>PBY’s</span> were spotted overhead the morning of the 3<sup>rd</sup>,
                so it was no surprise when a strike from Midway attacked his fleet before his
                first strike could hit the airfield on Eastern Midway Island.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Midway had time to launch <span class=GramE>
                  all
                  of
                </span> her fighters, but they were comprised of outdated Buffalo F2A as well
                as the not exactly superb F4F wildcat numbering 24 in total versus the nimble
                and superior A6M zero.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The United States
                lost 2 of the F4F’s and the 13 of the Buffaloes were slaughtered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many of the American pilots had not faced the
                zero and survivors were stunned at how inferior their planes were wanting <span class=GramE>both of them</span> retired, not just the F2A which mostly served
                as a trainer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While the Japanese
                devastated Midway’s infrastructure, power, and fuel facilities, they failed to
                significantly damage the <span class=GramE>air field</span> while having over
                20% of their attack planes lost or out of service after the attack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The strike from Midway failed to inflict
                significant damage on the Japanese fleet; even a number of B-17’s dropping
                numerous large bombs failed to score hits as their high-altitude bombs left the
                Japanese carriers ample time for evasive maneuvers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nagumo set out to rearm his carrier attack
                forces for a follow-up attack on Midway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>Before that could be completed, one of his PBY’s, coincidentally the
                only one to have mechanical issues delaying her launch by at least half an hour
                found the US carrier fleet to the Northeast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>This led to Nagumo’s dilemma.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
                had to coordinate landing his returning strike, yet again rearming his planes,
                or launching planes with sub-optimally armed for a carrier strike.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He chose to recover his strike, rearm, and
                make a massive strike on whatever US forces where to the Northeast.<o:p></o:p>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>
              <span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                Unfortunately
                for Nagumo, the rest of the day his fleet would be largely occupied dealing
                with attacks from United States planes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>Aside from the strike from Midway, US fliers, inexperienced US fliers,
                failing to organize into a consolidated attack showed up in small waves that
                generally prevented the Japanese from launching their strike despite most of
                them failing to score any hits on Japanese forces for most of the day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>TBD pilots had generally thought well of
                their plane up until this battle, and they had managed to perform <span class=GramE>fairly well</span> in the Coral Sea due to optimum conditions and
                an ability to bracket Japanese carriers, but at Midway TBD’s showed up in
                isolated squadrons having to approach carriers behind massive walls of AA and
                they were butchered, generally before they could get close enough to drop their
                torpedoes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dropped from one side at a
                distance, the torpedoes were not difficult for Japanese carriers to dodge, and
                unbeknownst to most of those TBD pilots, their torpedoes most often did not
                explode if they did manage a hit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>Despite this, most TBD squadrons that day pushed on against overwhelming
                odds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No torpedo hits were scored on
                Japanese carriers, but these brave TBD crews won the war by giving up their
                lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each time a TBD squadron showed
                up, they forced the Japanese to go into evasive maneuvers and delayed their
                attack on the US fleet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The USS Hornet,
                with perhaps the least experienced flight crew and fighter complement having
                been pulled straight out of training into serving as the platform for the
                Doolittle raid, launched their strike far out to the west as the United States
                did not know if the Japanese had four carriers in one group or two separate
                groups with one farther behind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a
                result, their first launch led to the infamous Flight to Nowhere, but LCDR
                Waldron, refusing to follow orders that were clearly leading them away from the
                carriers took his TBD’s and broke off to the south.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His squadron arrived yet again just in time
                to force the Japanese onto defense yet again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>The entire squadron was annihilated including LCDR Waldron, though one
                pilot, Ensign George gay managed to survive by hiding under a seat cushion in
                sight of Japanese forces on all sides.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>Waldron’s move, though, saved the United States that day as Japanese
                combat air patrols, suffering from poor radio communication systems, failed to
                properly maintain high- and low-level patrols with most of their planes
                greedily chasing down <span class=GramE>TBD’s</span> for more kills.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would provide the United States the
                opportunity it needed.<o:p></o:p>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>
              <span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                While the
                Japanese were busy defending from TBD attacks taking evasive action to avoid
                torpedoes, LCMDR McClusky’s squadron of scout bombers in VF-6 had arrived at
                where the Japanese carrier fleet had been only to find them missing (they had
                moved to the Northwest).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Faced with the
                decision to divert to Midway to refuel or return to the Enterprise, McClusky
                astutely noticed the IJN Arashi, a Japanese destroyed steaming north at flank
                speed which he correctly surmised was towards the Japanese fleet – his decision
                to follow that destroyer was later called by Nimitz the most important decision
                of the entire battle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In another moment
                of benevolence, earlier that morning the USS Nautilus had attempting to attack
                the Japanese fleet and the Arashi had been sent to attempt to hunt her
                down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They came upon the Japanese fleet
                with much of its fighter cover at sea level after chasing the TBD’s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was confusion over target assignment
                with most bombers going after <span class=GramE>Kaga</span> but Lt. Richard
                Best and his two wingmen diverted in time to attack the Akagi.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Kaga took 4 hits and was a burning
                wreck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Akagi, though seemingly
                better off would later explode as gas vapors would spread and find an ignition
                source.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In another favorable moment for
                the United States, just as McClusky’s flight group arrived in the Southwest,
                the Yorktown’s squadron of SBD’s arrived <span class=GramE>to</span> the
                Northeast – a matter of absolute failure to coordinate leading to a perfect
                bracketing of the fleet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Yorktown
                fliers pummeled the Soryu leaving her a burning wreck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unfortunately, Hiryu was just over the
                horizon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She launched a strike which
                followed the American pilots back to Yorktown where they disabled her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was rapidly repaired but a subsequent
                strike caused more significant damage before a joint strike by Yorktown and
                Enterprise bombers left Hiryu ablaze – Lt. Richard Best again scoring one of
                the four hits that doomed her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All four
                Japanese carriers were then, ironically, sunk by torpedoes… Japanese torpedoes
                before the fleet <span class=GramE>retreated back</span> towards Japan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yorktown almost pulled another miraculous
                recovery, but the IJN I-168, an intrepid submarine managed to put two torpedoes
                into the Yorktown followed by a third into the destroyer USS <span class=SpellE>Hammann</span> that had been tending to her – leading to the loss
                of 80 lives.<o:p></o:p>
              </span>
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>
              <span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                As good as
                the original game is, it did seem to favor some misperceptions that are also
                seen in the 1976 film Midway – <span class=GramE>that armed planes</span> on
                the deck led to great explosions that put the carriers out of action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most historians now seem to favor fuel vapors
                building up in the hangars and poor damage control practices exacerbating
                Japanese losses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have remodeled that
                game to focus less on the planes on deck though there are still explosions, and
                the United States has an even more dramatic edge in damage control than
                provided in the original game.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While the
                player may not know it, the Japanese carriers do follow Yamamoto’s orders on <span class=GramE>way</span> in with half the fleet armed for ground attack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the Japanese fleet discovers the US
                carriers, they will rearm potentially leading to a delay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another factor the original game did not
                consider is the US having radar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have
                incorporated potential contact spotting by submarines and radar in addition to
                PBY scout planes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If a contact is
                spotted on radar, it is not identified, but can provide a player <span class=GramE>clues</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of more
                import, if the Japanese launch a strike, you will be warned of approaching
                bogies by the radar crew… well, most of the time – there is some chance they
                will consider it a weather anomaly or friendly planes and not report it – as
                tended to happen in the early days of radar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
                </span>I have also added in visual spotting of adjacent forces as it only makes
                common sense.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a future version, I
                probably will allow you to launch scout strikes to go where you THINK the
                Japanese fleet is…<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>at a slightly greater
                risk of planes splashing (especially if they are from the Hornet).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also plan on adding in the B-17’s from
                Midway as an option to harass the Japanese periodically until they put Midway
                airfield out of operation or destroy them on the ground.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The game does not currently delay Japanese
                flight operations if the US <span class=GramE>attacks, but</span> requiring
                decisions on whether to launch or continue evasion and forcing you to turn into
                the wind for launching strikes might be added in a future version.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did give the Yorktown fighters a
                significant edge as compared to other US fighter squadrons based on LCMDR Jimmy
                Thach of Yorktown’s VF-3 successfully implementing what would later become
                known as the “Thach weave” – a tactic where F4F’s, rather than attempting to
                outturn the far nimbler Zero’s would weave back and forth with their wingman so
                that either could shoot any zero off the tail of the other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While far nimbler, the A6M Zero lacked a
                self-sealing gas tank and was not hard to shoot down if you could get it in
                front of your plane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This doctrine would
                later be taught to all F4F squadrons along with some other tactics to help
                somewhat even the playing field, but at Midway, only Thach’s group was using
                this tactic.<o:p></o:p>
              </span>
            </p>

              <span style='font-size:18.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                The original
                game also included an escort carrier, the Zuiho, in the Japanese troop
                transport group.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have not only kept
                this in, but this carrier now will actively go to war at times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition to performing CAP for the
                transports against air attacks, she will venture out with a strike force of her
                own if the situation calls for it – say no other carriers are around (or still
                afloat) – and there is a target in range.<o:p></o:p>

                While I have
                not yet implemented multi-level CAP which might be more complicated than the
                game needs, I did add some more CAP and squadron diversion logic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are limits on how many planes can
                divert to a carrier, though diversions to Midway face no such limit as there is
                no space limit there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Much as in real
                life, the TBD <span class=GramE>squadron’s</span> are almost a wasted effort in
                this game, though they do occasionally score some devastating hits, but more
                importantly, CAP has a recovery time in this game – if subsequent waves show up
                in sequence, Japanese fighter cover can be inadequate.<o:p></o:p>
